# Introduction
Hi, 
 I'm Arshad.<br/>
 I've been fascinated with programming since highschool.<br/>
 This is a collection of my work done throughout the years.

# 2014
I made my first calculator on Visual Basic .NET.
<br/>Unfortunately I can't find the old code anywhere. Here is a **[new]()** one I recently made.

A month after I tried my hand at Lua on the Roblox platform. It was a horrific experience in Roblox back then.
<br/>**[Here](https://www.roblox.com/games/147625751/DragonBall-To-be-named)** is a place I made on roblox back in 2014.
<br/>**BE WARNED IT IS HORRIBLE AND FULL OF BUGS.**

# 2017
The years went by, I learned how to animate though I'm bad at it.<br/>
I tried Blender, very pleasant experience. I was proud how it turned it out.<br/>
While making meshes, I met a friend who was searching for a developer for his game, [Dragon Ball Reality's End](https://www.roblox.com/games/1240311814/Dragon-Realitys-End-BACKUP).<br/>
That is when I noticed how bad I was at vfx creation and manipulation...<br/>
It never came out, but it was a success for me for I learned how to use Blender.<br/>
I made the hairs, partially.
A few months later... I started development a new game.

# 2018
This time I started with physics manipulation. I learned whatever I could about body physics for a few months.<br/>
Late 2017, when I was finally out of highschool, my idea came to fruition.<br/>
A 3DMG, 3 Dimensional Maneuvre Gear from the famous anime, **Attack on Titan**.<br/>
<br/>Here are a few images to commemorate that time :
